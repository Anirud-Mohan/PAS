# Passport-Automation-System
The purpose of this Python project is to create a passport automation system demo that automates the Level-1 process in applying for a new passport. It has multiple areas, including signup and login. If a user forgets their password, they can restore it by using an otp produced by the system to authenticate their email. They can also register for a password and check their status after making a purchase.
